mlogr
-----
A simple application aiming to aid humans doing repetative data collection.

mlogr features simple configuration for setting up (line-based) log
structure. Using a simple text based user interface looping for input.
Once new log data is entered this is committed to a SQLite database. After
data write mlogr runs a post hook, see hooks directory for example
post-hook that commits mlogr.db to ``mlogr-data'' branch in the mlogr git
repo.

The software mlogr is written in Python, it uses SQLite3 as data backend,
YAML for configuration.


DATA
----
The data mlogr stores are put in sqlite tables. Every logged row is stamped
with id and time. The rest of the data is given by the user. The data
format is defined in the configuration file (default is mlogr.conf). See
example for detailed explanation.
